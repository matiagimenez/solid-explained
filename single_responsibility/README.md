# SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the first of the five principles of SOLID, is a fundamental concept in object-oriented software development.

## Definition

This principle states that a class should have **only one reason to change**, meaning it should be responsible for only one part of the softwareâ€™s functionality.

If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes tightly coupled. A change in one responsibility will likely require changes in another, making the code harder to maintain and modify.

Classes focused on a single responsibility are easier to test because you do not have to deal with multiple functionalities during the testing of a specific functionality.

### Real world analogy

Imagine a team in a restaurant. In this team, we have various functions: cooks, waiters, and the manager. Each of these team members has a unique responsibility. The cooks prepare the food, the waiters serve the food to the customers, and the manager takes care of the restaurantâ€™s administration. Imagine the chaos if a single person tried to perform all these tasks, it would generate a totally inefficient and confusing system.

Similarly, a class in software should specialize in a single functionality or responsibility.
